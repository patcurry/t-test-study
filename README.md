I created a fake dataset for 10 males and 10 females by looking at csv files with heights by gender that I found on internet.

I will make programs in various programming languages that read the csv, and run a t-test comparing male heights to female hights.

The first thing to do will be writing a function that reads the csv data and puts it into two arrays.

Then there will be a function the takes the data from each list and essentially runs the t-test. 

Then last part will be outputting the result to the command line.

I will start with the python implementation.
